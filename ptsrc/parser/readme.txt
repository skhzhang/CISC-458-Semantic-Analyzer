Brief Explanation of the File structure: 
This folder include: 
- all the origin files, inclduding the three files we modified (scan.ssl, parser.pt, stdIdentifiers)

- A txt file called Phase1_Documentation.txt which stores the documentation we made as we work through the project. 
	- Including a rationale of the purpose for each test cases we designed.

- files with *_old indicate that it is the original file from the parser folder.

- the diff files: scan_diff.txt and parser_diff.txt.

- inline comments have been provided in the source code beside each line of change, to make things more clear.

- A sub-folder called Test_Case, which is created to store all the Test_Cases. The test cases are sorted by Phases, with a script to automate the process.
	- the current working directory storing the test cases for this phase is called Phase_1
	- inside Phase_1 there are the .pt files -> test cases, and a result.txt, showing results of ssltrace.
	- To re-iterate, the purpose for each test cases have been included in the Phase1_Documentation.txt under /parser
